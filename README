This README file provides informations about how to set-up the 
make.inc file and successfully compile the code in this 
portable branch.

EDIT MAKE.INC:
==================================================================
The make.inc file contains some informaions about the system 
1) the fortran (95) compiler used, with some additional flags like:
   a) the flag to choose in which directory compile the .mod files 
      (output from compiling modules)
   b) the optimization/debug options of the compiler
In the local ./etc dir there several example of make.inc for LINUX 
and OSX architecture and Intel and GNU fortran compilers.

2) the MATHEMATICAL library to use. The codes are developed 
using MKL from Intel. A minimal alternative is to use standard 
Blas/Lapack libraries, that have to be compatible (i.e. compiled) 
with the chosen compiler. If no MKL is available, then you should:
   a) set the absolute path to LAPACK directory  
   b) set the absolute path to BLAS directory
   c) uncomment the definition of MATHLIB alternative to the MKL 
      based one

COMPILE LIBSCIFOR:
=========================================================
$make lib

if no errors occurs, this process should create the libraries:
./library_src/libscifor.a
./library_src/libscifor_deb.a
and a bunch of .mod files located in the library_src directory.
The modules are included thry the -I statements specified in the 
make.inc file.

If something goes wrong you must read the error message and edit 
the make.inc file accordingly.

3) Copy the necessary source files into the main local directory, 
keeping the same structure as in the remote computer.
Edit the local Makefile to:
     a) include the local make.inc (rather than other files)
     b) rename local variables
If necessary compare with the makefile.template available in 
local ./etc.
