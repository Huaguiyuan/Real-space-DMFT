This is a brief how-to add a solver to this RDMFT wrapper.

The RDMFT layer insist on a given solver, contained in a given directory.
The solver routines is compiled into a library first. The call to the solver
must be crated and wrapped into a specific module, e.g. RDMFT_WRAP_IPT.f90

To avoid repetition of input variables and making use of the novel created 
PARSE_INPUT module, ALL the input variables for the solver should be 
merged into the RDMFT module RDMFT_INPUT_VARS.

This module contains all teh input variables passed to the RDMFT code, 
either to the solver or to the RDMFT itself.

The procedure is thus:
1. Create a directory XXX_SOLVER
2. Copy all the source files into the directory with the Makefile
3. Dump all the input variables for this solver into the RDMFT_INPUT_VARS, 
taking care of possible repetition. At this step you should check variables 
naming and copy new variables values from already defined variables. (e.g. 
suppose your solver define L as the number of Matsubara frequencies, the 
RDMFT_INPUT_VARS already contains a variable to this purpose named Lmats, so
you should add L as a variable definiton but you should copy its value 
from Lmats [L=Lmats] after reading. this avoid articial increase of the 
input file with new variables and compatibility with working solvers).
4. Modify the input variable module in the solver to USE the RDMFT_INPUT_VARS.
(if step 3. is done properly, this step should not produce any error)
5. Modify the Makefile of the solver to compile FIRST the rdmft input variables 
module, to compile the solver into a library. Follow the structure of the 
existing solver Makefiles.
6. Create a WRAPPER for this solver, which perform the parallel calls to 
the solver routines as requried. see RDMFT_WRAP_IPT.
7. Add a compilation entry into the RDMFT Makefile.
